# Predictive Analysis Using Time Series to Identify Problematic Bank Transactions

This project utilizes ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models to perform predictive analysis on time series data from bank transactions. The goal is to forecast future transaction behavior and identify anomalies that may indicate potential issues, such as fraudulent activities or operational errors.

## Background
Banks handle large volumes of transactions daily, making it essential to quickly and accurately identify problematic transactions that could indicate fraud, errors, or compliance issues. Traditional rule-based methods can miss complex patterns, leading to undetected anomalies. This project uses ARIMA, a robust time series forecasting method, to predict transaction patterns and flag anomalies automatically.

### Why ARIMA for Bank Transactions?
ARIMA is well-suited for time series forecasting, especially for stationary data. It combines three components:
- **AutoRegressive (AR)**: Uses past transaction values to predict future ones, leveraging historical behavior.
- **Integrated (I)**: Applies differencing to make the transaction data stationary, stabilizing trends and variance over time.
- **Moving Average (MA)**: Incorporates past forecast errors to adjust predictions, improving the model's accuracy.

## Steps

### Step 1: Data Preparation
- **Data Collection**: Raw bank transaction data is stored in the `data/raw` folder. This data includes transaction timestamps, amounts, and other relevant details.
- **Data Cleaning**: Clean the data to handle missing values, filter out noise, and standardize transaction descriptions using the `data_preprocessing.ipynb` notebook or `data_preprocessing.py` script.
- **Stationarity Check**: Verify the dataâ€™s stationarity using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test. Apply differencing as needed to make the data suitable for ARIMA modeling.

### Step 2: ARIMA Model Training
- **Parameter Identification**: Use AutoCorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial AutoCorrelation Function (PACF) plots to determine optimal values for AR (p), I (d), and MA (q).
- **Model Training**: Train the ARIMA model on the processed transaction data using the `arima_modeling.ipynb` notebook or `arima_model.py` script.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to ensure reliable predictions.

### Step 3: Anomaly Detection
- **Forecasting**: Generate predictions for upcoming transactions.
- **Error Analysis**: Compare forecasted transactions against actual outcomes to identify significant discrepancies.
- **Flagging Problematic Transactions**: Transactions with errors beyond a set threshold are flagged for further investigation, indicating potential fraud or operational issues.

### Step 4: Visualization and Reporting
- **Visualization**: Plot the transaction time series, forecast results, and detect anomalies using visualization tools like Matplotlib to provide clear insights.
- **Reporting**: Summarize findings, highlighting flagged transactions and their potential impact, aiding in proactive decision-making.

## Conclusion
Using ARIMA for bank transaction analysis enhances the ability to detect problematic transactions efficiently and accurately. By forecasting expected transaction patterns and identifying significant deviations, this approach provides an automated and scalable solution to monitor large volumes of transactions.

### Key Takeaways:
- **Improved Anomaly Detection**: Enhances detection accuracy beyond traditional rule-based methods.
- **Automated Monitoring**: Reduces manual transaction review efforts, allowing for real-time analysis.
- **Scalability**: Easily adaptable for different types of bank transaction data with minor adjustments.

## Challenges
1. **Data Stationarity**: Ensuring the transaction data is stationary is critical but often requires extensive preprocessing.
2. **Parameter Tuning**: Identifying the best ARIMA parameters (p, d, q) can be complex and require several iterations.
3. **Threshold Setting**: Balancing anomaly detection thresholds to avoid false positives or negatives is challenging.
4. **Seasonality Handling**: Standard ARIMA does not handle seasonal patterns well, requiring modifications like SARIMA for more complex time series.
5. **Data Quality Issues**: Transaction data can be noisy, with varying descriptions and formats, making preprocessing crucial for model performance.

## Future Work
- **Integration of SARIMA**: To handle seasonal variations in transaction patterns more effectively.
- **Advanced Detection Techniques**: Incorporate machine learning models like Isolation Forests to complement ARIMA-based anomaly detection.
- **Real-time Monitoring Dashboard**: Develop an interactive dashboard for live monitoring and alerts for flagged transactions.

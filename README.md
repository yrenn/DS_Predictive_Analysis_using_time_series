## ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
Definition: ARIMA is a classic time series forecasting model suitable for stationary time series. It combines three components: AutoRegressive (AR), Integrated (I), and Moving Average (MA).
Components:
•	AutoRegressive (AR): Utilizes past values to predict the current value.
•	Integrated (I): Applies differencing to make non-stationary data stationary.
•	Moving Average (MA): Uses past forecast errors to improve the prediction of the current value.
